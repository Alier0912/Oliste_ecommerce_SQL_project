### Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist

 #### Welcome!

*    This is a Brazilian ecommerce public dataset of orders made at Olist Store. 

* The dataset has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil.

* Its features allows viewing an order from multiple dimensions: from order status, price, payment and freight performance to customer location, product attributes and finally reviews written by customers.

* We also released a geolocation dataset that relates Brazilian zip codes to lat/lng coordinates
